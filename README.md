# Color Detector
It's a project which detect the color from any image.  
Currently this project is **not viewable for landscape orientation** because I haven't added landscape orientation style for tags as I'm making this code on mobile.  
Stay tuned for the upcoming updates!

## How to use
1. **Choose Image** from local storage
2. Tap on the place on picture from where you want to take the color value
3. Copy the color values and use it as per your needs... 

### Desktop user can resize their window such that height is more than width of window so that they can use the detector.
